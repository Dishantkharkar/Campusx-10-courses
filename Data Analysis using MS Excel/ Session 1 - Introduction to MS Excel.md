Certainly. I'll explain in detail some of the most commonly used Excel formulas, including UNIQUE, SUM, SUMIF, and several others.

1. UNIQUE

The UNIQUE function is relatively new, introduced in Excel 365.

Syntax: =UNIQUE(array, [by_col], [exactly_once])

Purpose: Returns a list of unique values from a range or array.

Example:
=UNIQUE(A1:A10)

This will return a list of unique values from the range A1:A10, removing any duplicates.

Key points:
- It's dynamic, updating automatically if the source data changes
- Can work with columns or rows
- The 'exactly_once' parameter can be used to return only values that appear exactly once in the array

2. SUM

Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)

Purpose: Adds all the numbers in a range of cells.

Example:
=SUM(A1:A10)

This will add all numbers in the range A1:A10.

Key points:
- Can add individual values, cell references, ranges, or a mix of these
- Ignores text and logical values

3. SUMIF

Syntax: =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])

Purpose: Sums the values in a range that meet specific criteria.

Example:
=SUMIF(A1:A10, ">100", B1:B10)

This will sum the values in B1:B10, but only for rows where the corresponding value in A1:A10 is greater than 100.

Key points:
- If sum_range is omitted, it uses the range specified in the first parameter
- Criteria can be numbers, text, or expressions (like ">100")

4. VLOOKUP

Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

Purpose: Searches for a value in the first column of a table array and returns a value in the same row from another column.

Example:
=VLOOKUP("Apple", A1:C10, 2, FALSE)

This will look for "Apple" in the first column of A1:C10, and return the corresponding value from the second column.

5. IF

Syntax: =IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)

Purpose: Returns one value if a condition is true and another value if it's false.

Example:
=IF(A1>10, "High", "Low")

This will return "High" if A1 is greater than 10, otherwise "Low".

6. COUNTIF

Syntax: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)

Purpose: Counts the number of cells within a range that meet the given criteria.

Example:
=COUNTIF(A1:A10, ">5")

This will count how many cells in A1:A10 contain a value greater than 5.

7. AVERAGE

Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1, [number2], ...)

Purpose: Returns the arithmetic mean of the arguments.

Example:
=AVERAGE(A1:A10)

This will calculate the average of the values in A1:A10.

8. INDEX and MATCH (often used together)

INDEX syntax: =INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])
MATCH syntax: =MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])

Purpose: When used together, they provide a more flexible lookup method than VLOOKUP.

Example:
=INDEX(C1:C10, MATCH("Apple", A1:A10, 0))

This will find "Apple" in A1:A10 and return the corresponding value from C1:C10.

These formulas are fundamental to many Excel tasks and form the building blocks of more complex spreadsheet solutions. Each can be nested within others or combined to create powerful, custom functions tailored to specific needs.

The use of the dollar sign ($) in Excel formulas is related to cell referencing and is crucial for creating flexible, reusable formulas. This concept is called "absolute" and "relative" cell referencing. Let's explore this in detail:

Types of Cell References:

1. Relative References (e.g., A1, B2)
2. Absolute References (e.g., $A$1, $B$2)
3. Mixed References (e.g., $A1, A$1)

Detailed Explanation:

1. Relative References:
   - Default type of reference
   - Changes when the formula is copied to another cell
   - Example: If A1 contains =B1, and you copy this to A2, it becomes =B2

2. Absolute References:
   - Does not change when copied
   - Uses $ before both the column letter and row number
   - Example: If A1 contains =$B$1, and you copy this to A2, it remains =$B$1

3. Mixed References:
   - Partially absolute and partially relative
   - $ can be used before column or row independently
   - Example: $A1 (absolute column, relative row) or A$1 (relative column, absolute row)

Use of $ in Rows and Columns:

1. $A$1: Both column and row are absolute
   - Use when you always want to refer to a specific cell, regardless of where the formula is copied

2. $A1: Column is absolute, row is relative
   - Use when you want to keep the column fixed but allow the row to change when copied

3. A$1: Row is absolute, column is relative
   - Use when you want to keep the row fixed but allow the column to change when copied

Practical Examples:

1. Creating a multiplication table:
   - In B1, enter: =A1
   - In B2, enter: =$A2*B$1
   - Copy B2 across and down to create the table
   - The $A keeps the column A fixed as you copy across
   - The $1 keeps the row 1 fixed as you copy down

2. Percentage calculation:
   - In B2, enter a total value
   - In C2, enter a partial value
   - In D2, enter: =C2/$B$2
   - Copy D2 down to calculate percentages for other rows
   - $B$2 keeps the total fixed for all calculations

Benefits of Using $:

1. Flexibility: Allows formulas to be copied without losing reference to key cells
2. Efficiency: Saves time by enabling quick formula replication
3. Accuracy: Reduces errors by ensuring correct cell references when copying formulas
4. Adaptability: Makes spreadsheets easier to modify and expand

Tips for Using $:

1. Use F4 key: Pressing F4 while editing a cell reference cycles through different $ combinations
2. Plan ahead: Consider how formulas will be copied before deciding on reference types
3. Use named ranges: For frequently referenced cells, named ranges can be an alternative to $ references

Understanding and effectively using $ in Excel formulas is a key skill for creating robust, scalable spreadsheets. It allows for more complex calculations and data analysis while minimizing the risk of errors when copying formulas.
