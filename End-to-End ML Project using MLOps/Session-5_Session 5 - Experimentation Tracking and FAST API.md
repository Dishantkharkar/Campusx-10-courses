# Session 5 - Experimentation Tracking and FAST API

Experiment tracking is a crucial process in the lifecycle of developing machine learning models and conducting data science experiments. It involves systematically recording various aspects of the experiments to ensure reproducibility, facilitate comparison, and enable better decision-making. Hereâ€™s an in-depth look at experiment tracking:

### Key Components of Experiment Tracking

1. **Metadata Collection**:
   - **Experiment Configuration**: This includes parameters like hyperparameters, model architectures, and dataset versions used in the experiment. Configuration parameters can be static (like learning rate, batch size) or dynamic (like early stopping criteria).
   - **Code Versioning**: Tracking the version of the codebase, including scripts, notebooks, and libraries, ensures that the exact environment and code used in an experiment can be reproduced.
   - **Environment Details**: Information about the hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU) and software environment (e.g., operating system, Python version, library versions) is crucial for reproducibility.


2. **Data Management**:
   - **Input Data**: Details of the datasets used, including paths, versions, and any preprocessing steps applied.
   - **Output Data**: Results generated by the experiments, such as model predictions, evaluation metrics, and artifacts like trained models.

3. **Experiment Execution**:
   - **Execution Logs**: Capturing logs during the experiment helps in debugging and understanding the experiment flow.
   - **Run Identifiers**: Assigning unique identifiers to each run helps in tracking and differentiating between different experiments.

4. **Results and Metrics**:
   - **Performance Metrics**: Collecting and storing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, loss values, etc., for each run.
   - **Visualizations**: Recording visual outputs such as plots of loss curves, confusion matrices, and other graphical representations of results.

5. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - **Baseline Comparisons**: Comparing new experiments against baseline models to assess improvements.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically comparing different hyperparameter settings to identify optimal configurations.

### Tools and Platforms for Experiment Tracking

Several tools and platforms facilitate efficient experiment tracking, providing both basic and advanced features to support the components listed above:

1. **MLflow**:
   - Offers a comprehensive suite for experiment tracking, including logging and querying experiments.
   - Supports model management, allowing easy deployment and sharing of models.
   - Integrates with various machine learning libraries and frameworks.

2. **Weights & Biases**:
   - Provides extensive logging capabilities, real-time collaborative experiment tracking, and visualizations.
   - Supports hyperparameter sweeps, comparison of results, and integration with popular ML libraries.

3. **TensorBoard**:
   - Developed by TensorFlow, it provides visualization tools to track and visualize experiment metrics.
   - Offers tools for profiling and inspecting model training.

4. **Neptune.ai**:
   - Focuses on experiment tracking and model management with a user-friendly interface.
   - Enables detailed logging of experiments, results comparison, and team collaboration.

5. **DVC (Data Version Control)**:
   - Focuses on versioning data and models alongside code.
   - Ensures reproducibility by tracking data, code, and experiments together.

### Best Practices for Experiment Tracking

1. **Automate Logging**: Automate the collection of experiment parameters, metrics, and logs to minimize manual errors and ensure completeness.
2. **Use Version Control**: Leverage version control systems like Git to track changes in code and integrate it with experiment tracking tools.
3. **Standardize Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for experiments, parameters, and datasets to avoid confusion.
4. **Document Experiments**: Maintain detailed documentation for each experiment, including the purpose, methodology, and observations.
5. **Collaborative Tracking**: Use tools that support team collaboration to share insights, results, and improve collective knowledge.

### Conclusion

Experiment tracking is a fundamental practice in data science and machine learning projects, enabling reproducibility,
facilitating collaboration, and enhancing the overall quality of experiments. By systematically recording and analyzing
experiments, practitioners can make informed decisions, optimize models, and achieve better results efficiently.
