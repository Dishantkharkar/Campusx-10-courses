### Pandas: Vectorized Operations and Broadcasting
**Vectorized Operations in Pandas:**
Vectorized operations in Pandas allow for efficient data manipulation by applying operations directly to entire arrays (or Series/DataFrames) without the need for explicit loops. This approach leverages NumPy's underlying implementation, which uses highly optimized C code for performance.

**Broadcasting in Pandas:**
Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array's dimensions to match the larger array. In Pandas, broadcasting can be used to apply operations across entire DataFrames or Series efficiently.

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Vectorized addition with broadcasting
df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']
print(df)
```
Here, the addition operation is vectorized and broadcasted across each element of the columns 'A' and 'B', resulting in a new column 'C'.

### NumPy: Memory-Mapped Files
**Concept of Memory-Mapped Files:**
Memory-mapped files are a method of accessing large files on disk as if they were in memory. This allows for efficient reading and writing of large datasets without loading the entire file into RAM.

**Using Memory-Mapped Files with NumPy:**
NumPy provides support for memory-mapped files through `numpy.memmap`, enabling efficient manipulation of large arrays stored in files.

**Example:**
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a memory-mapped file
data = np.memmap('large_data.dat', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(10000, 10000))

# Perform operations on the memory-mapped array
data[:100] = np.random.rand(100, 10000)

# Flush changes to disk
data.flush()
```
Memory-mapped files are particularly useful for handling datasets that exceed the available memory, as they allow for on-demand loading of data.

### Scikit-learn: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
**Bias-Variance Tradeoff:**
The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the tradeoff between the model's ability to generalize to new data (variance) and its performance on the training data (bias).

- **High Bias:** Models with high bias (underfitting) make strong assumptions about the data and have low complexity. They may perform poorly on both training and testing data.
- **High Variance:** Models with high variance (overfitting) have high complexity and fit the training data very well but may perform poorly on new, unseen data.

**Impact on Generalization:**
Balancing bias and variance is crucial for building models that generalize well. Scikit-learn provides tools like cross-validation to help tune models and achieve this balance.

### Matplotlib: Custom Colormaps
**Defining Custom Colormaps:**
Matplotlib allows users to create custom colormaps to represent specific data patterns or categories, which can enhance the visualization of data.

**Example:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap

# Define custom colormap
colors = ["blue", "green", "yellow", "red"]
n_bins = [3, 6, 10, 100]  # Discretizes the interpolation into bins
cmap_name = 'my_list'

# Create the colormap
cm = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list(cmap_name, colors, N=n_bins)

# Use the colormap
data = np.random.rand(10, 10)
plt.imshow(data, cmap=cm)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```
Here, a custom colormap is defined using a list of colors and applied to visualize a random dataset.

### Seaborn: Violin Plots
**Statistical Reasoning:**
Violin plots in Seaborn combine features of box plots and kernel density plots. They are useful for visualizing the distribution of data, especially when there are potential outliers or when the data distribution is multimodal.

**Example:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a violin plot
sns.violinplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=data)
plt.show()
```
Violin plots provide a richer visualization by showing the density of the data at different values, which helps in identifying the distribution shape and potential outliers.

### TensorFlow: Backpropagation Algorithm
**Backpropagation Algorithm:**
Backpropagation is an optimization algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing the loss function. It involves the following steps:
1. **Forward Pass:** Compute the output of the network for a given input.
2. **Loss Calculation:** Calculate the error (loss) between the predicted output and the actual target.
3. **Backward Pass:** Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule.
4. **Weight Update:** Update the weights using gradient descent or a similar optimization algorithm.

**Role in Optimizing Model Parameters:**
Backpropagation adjusts the weights to minimize the loss function, leading to a trained model that generalizes well to new data.

### Pandas: Rolling Standard Deviation
**One-line Expression:**
```python
df['rolling_std'] = df['column_name'].rolling(window=5).std()
```
This calculates the rolling standard deviation of a specific column with a window size of 5.

### NumPy: Element-wise Multiplication Using Broadcasting
**Example:**
```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Element-wise multiplication using broadcasting
result = a * b
print(result)
```
Here, `b` is broadcasted to match the shape of `a` for element-wise multiplication.

### Scikit-learn: GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning
**Using GridSearchCV:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Define model and parameters
model = RandomForestClassifier()
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30]
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best parameters
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```
GridSearchCV evaluates different combinations of hyperparameters using cross-validation to find the best configuration.

### TensorFlow: Regularization Techniques (L1 and L2)
**Concept:**
Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 add a penalty to the loss function to prevent overfitting:
- **L1 Regularization:** Adds the absolute value of the weights to the loss function.
- **L2 Regularization:** Adds the squared value of the weights to the loss function.

**Implementation:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# L1 regularization
l1 = tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.01)

# L2 regularization
l2 = tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)

# Example model with L2 regularization
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
These regularization techniques help reduce overfitting by discouraging complex models.

        self.capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1
        else:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
            return self.cache[key]

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)

# Example usage
# lru_cache = LRUCache(2)
# lru_cache.put(1, 1)
# lru_cache.put(2, 2)
# print(lru_cache.get(1))  # Output: 1
# lru_cache.put(3, 3)
# print(lru_cache.get(2))  # Output: -1
```

#### 6. Flatten a Nested Dictionary
Given a nested dictionary with arbitrary levels of nesting, write a function to flatten it into a single-level dictionary with appropriate keys.

**Solution: Using Recursion**
```python
def flatten_dict(d, parent_key='', sep='_'):
    items = []
    for k, v in d.items():
        new_key = f'{parent_key}{sep}{k}' if parent_key else k
        if isinstance(v, dict):
            items.extend(flatten_dict(v, new_key, sep=sep).items())
        else:
            items.append((new_key, v))
    return dict(items)

# Example usage
# nested_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': {'e': 3}}}
# print(flatten_dict(nested_dict))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b_c': 2, 'b_d_e': 3}
```

#### 7. Find the Maximum Sum Subarray
Given an array of integers, find the subarray with the maximum sum.

**Solution: Using Kadane's Algorithm**
```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]

    for num in arr[1:]:
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current

    return max_global

# Example usage
# arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
# print(max_subarray_sum(arr))  # Output: 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])
```

#### 8. Egg Drop Problem
You are given two eggs and a building with n floors. From which floor should you drop the first egg to minimize the number of drops needed to find the floor that will break the egg?

**Solution: Dynamic Programming Approach**
```python
def egg_drop(n, k):
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][1] = i

    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[1][j] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(2, k + 1):
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for x in range(1, i + 1):
                res = 1 + max(dp[x - 1][j - 1], dp[i - x][j])
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], res)

    return dp[n][k]

# Example usage
# n = 100  # number of floors
# k = 2    # number of eggs
# print(egg_drop(n, k))  # Output: 14
```

#### 9. Validate a Binary Search Tree (BST)
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree where each node's value is greater than its left child and less than its right child.

**Solution: Using In-Order Traversal**
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_valid_bst(root, low=float('-inf'), high=float('inf')):
    if not root:
        return True

    if not (low < root.val < high):
        return False

    return (is_valid_bst(root.left, low, root.val) and
            is_valid_bst(root.right, root.val, high))

# Example usage
# root = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3))
# print(is_valid

### Preparing for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

#### 1. Solidify Your Python Basics

**Grasp Core Concepts:**
- **Data Types:** Understand basic data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- **Variables:** Learn how to declare and use variables in Python.
- **Operators:** Familiarize yourself with arithmetic, logical, comparison, and bitwise operators.
- **Control Flow:** Master the use of conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Functions:** Understand how to define and call functions, and grasp concepts like arguments, return values, and scope.

#### 2. Understand Object-Oriented Concepts

**Focus on Core OOP Concepts:**

- **Classes and Objects:**
  - **Class:** Blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure).
  - **Object:** An instance of a class.
  - **Attributes:** Variables that belong to a class or instance.
  - **Methods:** Functions that belong to a class or instance.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Example usage
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

- **Inheritance:**
  - Reusing code through parent-child relationships.
  - Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Example usage
dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

- **Encapsulation:**
  - Protecting data integrity within a class.
  - Restricting direct access to some of an object's components.

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Example usage
account = Account(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150
```

- **Polymorphism:**
  - Making objects behave differently in similar situations.
  - Allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

```python
class Cat:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

class Dog:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof"

def animal_sound(animal):
    print(animal.make_sound())

# Example usage
cat = Cat()
dog = Dog()
animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof
```

#### 3. Resources

**Online Tutorials and Courses:**
- **Coursera:** Python for Everybody by University of Michigan
- **edX:** Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) by University of Michigan
- **Udacity:** Intro to Object-Oriented Programming

**Books on Python OOP:**
- "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz
- "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
- "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho

#### 4. Practice Makes Perfect

**Start with Small Projects:**
- Implement simple OOP concepts in small projects, such as a basic bank account system or a simple library management system.

**Utilize Online Coding Challenges:**
- Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer OOP-specific challenges and exercises to practice and refine your skills.

**Example Project: Simple Library Management System**
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.is_checked_out = False

    def check_out(self):
        self.is_checked_out = True

    def return_book(self):
        self.is_checked_out = False

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)

    def list_books(self):
        for book in self.books:
            status = "Checked out" if book.is_checked_out else "Available"
            print(f"{book.title} by {book.author} - {status}")

# Example usage
library = Library()
book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
book2 = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")

library.add_book(book1)
library.add_book(book2)

library.list_books()  # Lists all books and their status
book1.check_out()
library.list_books()  # Lists all books with updated status
```

By following these steps and utilizing the resources mentioned, you can effectively prepare for Object-Oriented Programming in Python and solidify your understanding and application of OOP concepts.

### Difference Between a Class and an Object

- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have.
  - Example: `class Car`, which defines attributes like `color`, `model`, and methods like `drive()`.
  
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It is created based on the structure defined by the class and has actual values for the attributes defined by the class.
  - Example: `my_car = Car("red", "Toyota")`, where `my_car` is an object of the `Car` class.

### Concept of Encapsulation with an Example

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.

**Example:**

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.__account_number = account_number  # Private attribute
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Example usage
account = BankAccount("123456", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
```
In this example, `__balance` and `__account_number` are private attributes, and access to them is restricted through public methods like `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()`.

### The Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Inheritance:**
   - Allows one class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code reuse.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def make_sound(self):
             pass

     class Dog(Animal):
         def make_sound(self):
             return "Woof"
     ```

2. **Polymorphism:**
   - Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Cat:
         def make_sound(self):
             return "Meow"

     class Dog:
         def make_sound(self):
             return "Woof"

     def animal_sound(animal):
         print(animal.make_sound())

     cat = Cat()
     dog = Dog()
     animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
     animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof
     ```

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - Bundling data and methods that work on the data within one unit, and restricting access to some components.
   - **Example:**
     See the BankAccount example above.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

     class Shape(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def area(self):
             pass

     class Circle(Shape):
         def __init__(self, radius):
             self.radius = radius

         def area(self):
             return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
     ```

### Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance:**
   - A class inherits from one superclass.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Animal:
         pass

     class Dog(Animal):
         pass
     ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance:**
   - A class is derived from another derived class.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Animal:
         pass

     class Mammal(Animal):
         pass

     class Dog(Mammal):
         pass
     ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance:**
   - Multiple classes inherit from one superclass.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Animal:
         pass

     class Dog(Animal):
         pass

     class Cat(Animal):
         pass
     ```

4. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - A class inherits from more than one class.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     class Mammal:
         pass

     class Bird:
         pass

     class Bat(Mammal, Bird):
         pass
     ```

### Method Overriding vs. Overloading

- **Method Overriding:**
  - A child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    class Animal:
        def sound(self):
            pass

    class Dog(Animal):
        def sound(self):
            return "Woof"
    ```

- **Method Overloading:**
  - A single method name is used to perform different tasks, but Python does not support method overloading by default. It can be achieved by default parameters or using variable arguments.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    class Example:
        def add(self, a, b, c=0):
            return a + b + c
    ```

### Using a Superclass Method in Inheritance

You might use a superclass method when you want to extend or modify its behavior in the subclass without completely overriding it.

**Example:**

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        base_sound = super().sound()
        return f"{base_sound}, Woof"
```

### Polymorphism Concept and Benefits

**Polymorphism** allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, providing flexibility and integration of objects more seamlessly. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, thus promoting code reusability and efficiency.

**Benefits:**
- Improved code readability and maintainability.
- Easier to debug and extend.
- Supports the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### Static vs. Dynamic Polymorphism

- **Static Polymorphism:**
  - Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading. It is resolved at compile time.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    class Example:
        def add(self, a, b):
            return a + b

        def add(self, a, b, c):
            return a + b + c
    ```

- **Dynamic Polymorphism:**
  - Achieved through method overriding. It is resolved at runtime.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    class Animal:
        def sound(self):
            pass

    class Dog(Animal):
        def sound(self):
            return "Woof"
    ```

### Method Overriding and Polymorphism

Method overriding is a way to achieve polymorphism. By overriding a method, a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing the same method to perform different tasks.

**Example:**

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof
make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
```

### Abstract Classes and Interfaces

- **Abstract Classes:**
  - Cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed.
  - They can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).
  - **Purpose:** To define a common interface for subclasses.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Shape(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def area(self):
            pass
    ```

- **Interfaces:**
  - Not explicitly present in Python but can be mimicked using abstract classes with only abstract methods.
  - **Purpose:** To enforce certain methods to be implemented by subclasses.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Animal(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def sound(self):
            pass
    ```

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Inheritance

**Advantages:**
- Code reusability.
- Easy to extend existing functionality.
- Simplifies code by eliminating redundancy.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can lead to a tight coupling between classes.
- May introduce complexity with deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Changes in the superclass can impact all subclasses.

### Exception Handling in OOP

Exception handling is used to manage errors and exceptional conditions in a program gracefully. It allows a program to continue execution (or fail gracefully) despite encountering errors.

**Example:**

```python
class Calculator:
    def divide(self, a, b):
        try:
            return a / b
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            return "Cannot divide by zero"

# Example usage
calc = Calculator()
print(calc.divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
print(calc.divide(10, 0))  # Output: Cannot divide by zero
```

By utilizing exception handling, programs can avoid crashing and handle errors more effectively.

### Circular References

**Impact on Calculations:**
- Circular references occur when a formula directly or indirectly refers to its own cell, causing an infinite loop.
- They can lead to incorrect calculations, or Excel might display a warning or an error message.

**Identification and Resolution:**
- **Identify:**
  - Excel provides a warning message when a circular reference is detected.
  - Use the "Formulas" tab, then "Error Checking" to locate circular references.
- **Resolve:**
  - Break the circular reference by revising the formulas.
  - Use iterative calculation if the circular reference is intentional (enabled in Excel options).

### Volatile Functions

**Concept and Impact:**
- Volatile functions (e.g., NOW, TODAY, RAND) recalculate every time any change is made in the workbook.
- This can significantly slow down spreadsheet performance, especially with large datasets.

**Optimization:**
- Minimize the use of volatile functions.
- Use non-volatile alternatives where possible (e.g., use static timestamps instead of NOW).
- Limit the range of cells that trigger recalculations.

### Conditional Formatting

**Advanced Scenario:**
- Use formulas in conditional formatting to highlight rows based on a condition.
- Example: Highlight entire rows where sales exceed a certain threshold using a formula like `=$B2>1000`.

### Data Validation

**Enforcement and Benefits:**
- **Enforcement:**
  - Set rules to allow only specific data types (e.g., numbers, dates) via the "Data Validation" dialog.
  - Restrict entries to a range using settings like "Whole number between 1 and 100".
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents incorrect data entry, improving data integrity.
  - Provides guidance to users on valid data entries.

- Define custom calculations by adding calculated fields or items.
- **Example Scenario:**
  - Add a calculated field to find the profit margin using `= (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue`.

### Goal Seek vs. Solver

**Functionalities:**
- **Goal Seek:**
  - Finds the input value required to achieve a specific target value in a formula.
  - Simple and quick for single-variable problems.
- **Solver:**
  - Optimizes a formula by changing multiple variables, subject to constraints.
  - Suitable for more complex, multi-variable problems.

**Usage:**
- Use Goal Seek for straightforward, single-variable solutions.
- Use Solver for complex optimization problems with multiple constraints.

### Error Handling

**Purpose of Error Codes:**
- **#DIV/0!:** Division by zero.
- **#REF!:** Invalid cell reference.
- **#VALUE!:** Incorrect data type.
- **#NAME?:** Unrecognized formula name.

**Custom Error Handling:**
- Use functions like `IFERROR` or `ISERROR` to manage errors and provide user-friendly messages.
- Example: `=IFERROR(A1/B1, "Division Error")`.

### Dynamic Array Formulas

**Differences and Advantages:**
- **Differences:**
  - Dynamic arrays spill over multiple cells automatically.
